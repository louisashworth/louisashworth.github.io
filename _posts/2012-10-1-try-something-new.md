I'm really interested in the idea of specialism and choosing the right tool for the job, because it frustrates me when I hear, "I'm a PHP developer" or, "Ruby is better than Python". These languages are simply tools that we have available to do our jobs. You might know one tool better than another, as a builder or painter might, but surely you should always pick the best tool for the job?

I want to persuade you to try something new.

Languages, in the computing sense, are simply a syntax and grammar, a set of rules, for expressing ideas in a way a computer can read and execute, while also (hopefully) being human readable. At their essence they are all translated (compiled or interpreted) into ones and zeros.

Essentially languages don't make a difference, except that in higher-level languages (that is, PHP, Python, Ruby, JavaScript etc) there are generally more ones and zeros generated per single instruction, which (generally) equates to slower running speed. This isn't always the case, as some translation tools do a good job of optimising the translated code, like a good translator of human languages. When you're writing C, C++ or Assembler you are much closer to “the metal” and can expect increased performance at the expense of concise and expressive code.

What's important is that languages, by their nature, lend themselves to specific tasks and uses, just like real life languages. For example, traditional Chinese is extremely difficult to type because the words are not based on an alphabet of discrete characters but on unique combinations of strokes to form a whole word in one character. Conversely,the Indo-European family of languages are much better for typing, although this is is most likely because the concept of typing was invented by users of an alphabet. Who knows what we'd have if the Chinese had invented typing like they did writing?

In trying a different language, you may find a tool that will serve you well on a current or future project, and may even enable things that were otherwise impossible.

It will also give you a deeper understanding of programming as a whole; you'll see similarities between languages, and better understand why there are differences in the first place.

The best part is that it only requires a small time investment. There are now many 'tryX.org' sites and they are great for walking through the basics in a friendly environment.

Here's a select few to get you started:

- Ruby: [tryruby.org](http://tryruby.org/)
- Python: [trypython.org](http://www.trypython.org/)
- Haskell: [tryhaskell.org](http://tryhaskell.org/)
- Erlang: [tryerlang.org](http://tryerlang.org/)
- Clojure: [tryclj.com](http://tryclj.com/)

What are you waiting for? Go try something new!
