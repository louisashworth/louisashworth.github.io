title: "Technical Lead"
---

When I became tech lead of the TweetDeck team in mid-2016 I spent some time thinking about my goals as a lead.

As an exercise for myself, I wrote down what I expect from a lead and, using that list and [other brilliant resources](/2016/06/03/frontend-reading-list.html#professional-practice), the behaviours and attributes I hope to exhibit.

This post is a sort of check-list: I return to it periodically to make sure that I have recently paid some attention to everything on the list.

These days I am a tech lead on the GraphQL team, and my name is on some other internal projects in a leadership role. The teams are bigger; so is the scope for success or failure.

### What do I want from a lead?

- Clear explanation of *why* we’re doing something
- Quantifiable short and long-term goals
- Ownership where necessary with clear responsibilities and expectations
- Team advocacy — selling us and sharing our work
- Documented processes with justification
- Space to become expert

### How should I behave as a lead?

Within the team...

- Be as explicit and transparent as possible about project dependencies
- Run regular, project-focused meetings with a clear structure — attendees should know what to expect
- Transparently document project management process
- Trust the team to deliver when responsibility and ownership are given
- Be ready to explain *why* about anything, and able to say *I don’t know*
- Advocate for open-source and external sharing
- Challenge the team to solve problems in the way they want
- Encourage quantifiable, short and long-term goals
- Help team-mates with career advancement and growth

Outside of the team...

- Actively communicate with other teams about blockers
- Sell and share the team and their work
- Actively monitor for external changes that may affect the team

And, at all times, optimise for happiness.

### What are my responsibilities?

I think of GraphQL as product team and, as a result, this list significantly overlaps with what I perceive to be a Product Manager's responsibilities:

- Strategy and vision for the team
- Prioritised backlog for tactical decisions
- Quantifiable short and long-term goals
- Tracking progress for:
  - the team
  - outsiders
- Communication with:
  - stakeholders
  - customers
  - dependencies
- Team process
  - Lightweight, clear, no SPOFs
- Meeting facilitation
