title: Pleasant Irony
---
Thanks to [Richard Cunningham](http://twitter.com/#!/rythie), who submitted it, my post on [Consumption Addiction](http://phuu.net/2012/03/28/consumption-addition.html) did rather well on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3770357). Nothing of mine had ever been on there, so it was a (pleasant) surprise to see it at #4 for a good hour, and on the front page for some hours after.

I was totally blown away by the response, particularly the comment critiquing the article that was longer than what I'd actually written! It was interesting to note that I seemed to touch a nerve, perhaps it's a serious issue that needs more research and explanation.

I find it ironic however that Hacker News is precisely the kind of place where people lurk, consuming the fruit of other's labours. My hope would be that the article turns people from spending most of their time on Hacker News, or any other fixation, to spending just **some** time on it. I'm not saying reading interesting articles is bad â€” there's a time and place for all of it. Everything in moderation.

I promise to shut up about consumption now. For a while.
