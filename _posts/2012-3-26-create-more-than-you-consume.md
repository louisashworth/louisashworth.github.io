title: Create More Than You Consume
---

I recently read Chris Wake's post on Quora entitled [Habits of Ineffective People](http://www.quora.com/Chris-Wake/Posts/Hidden-habits-of-ineffective-people), and it seriously jarred me. I saw too much of myself reflected; it perfectly expressed the rut in which I'd found myself. Consuming far more than I'd been creating, I'd spent too much time worrying about vanity metrics and been lazy. Time to change.

I've come up with a set of rules for myself. They are pinned to the wall by my desk so that I never forget them.

I hope they help you too, particularly if you find yourself in the same situation.
