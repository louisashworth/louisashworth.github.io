I had a very productive day yesterday. I could attribute this to a number of things; for example, I’ve noticed that lines of code written is inversely proportional to number of biscuits consumed. It could also be that I’m feeling extremely motivated by what I’m [working on](https://github.com/phuu/extensio).

However, I made a change yesterday that I think was much more likely to have had an effect.

I turned off Growl.

(For those who don’t use it, Growl is a little utility that provides desktop notifications for a whole range of apps.)

Here’s when it pops up:

- HipChat gets a message
- Twitter finds a mention
- Rdio changes track
- Transmit finishes transferring
- Codekit’s done compiling
- Skype message
- Cloudapp’s finished uploading
- more...

Given that I’m on HipChat all day, use Twitter, Codekit and Cloudapp heavily and have Rdio on **all** the time, that’s a fair few notifications. But I didn’t realise how heavily I was being bombarded until suddenly there was silence.

It was fantastic.

Seriously, try it. Detach yourself from real-time updates and find your focus again.
