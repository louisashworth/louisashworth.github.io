title: Be Responsible
---
A great music teacher once described to me the important distinction between a player and a musician, and how I should always strive to be a musician. It has stuck with me ever since.

The player happily sits in rehearsals, plays the notes on the page and is technically good. There's nothing to complain about, but undoubtedly something is missing. The player would never move you to tears with their performance.

The musician listens and responds to others around her, is engaged with the music, takes an active interest in improving herself and pours time and energy into her craft. For the musician, the player is the baseline, and emotion is a key difference. The musician takes responsibility for the music she is part of creating.

When it comes to mastery of code, the analogy of a craftsman is good to a certain degree, but it falls down when you consider the pace of change of this fields. A craftsman will hone his technique for many years, learning from a master, often using the same techniques for all of that time. Clearly, that concept does not and cannot apply to technology and code, not least because its full history extends back a mere 60 years.

I prefer the analogy of the player and the musician. The baseline is to be a top-notch player: technically strong; good coding style and practices; doing the necessities well. From there, strive to be like the musician: engaged with your work; taking an active interest in self-improvement and learning; responsive to changes in best practice; responsible for your end product.

That last point, responsibility, may be the most important. Be a musician, be a craftsman. But be responsible for what you create.
