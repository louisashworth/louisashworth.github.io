title: Default to technology
---

I'm not the first to point it out that "if you build it, they will come" is simply false, but it seems this is forgotten even by [very competent, experienced teams](http://stet.editorially.com/articles/goodbye/).

While we are used to seeing hyperbolic reports of explosive growth in products and companies, particularly in the technology space, this kind of development is *not the rule*. They are clearly exceptions.

With this is mind, it *has* to be a high-priority for any new business to plan for slow, persistent gains that make ground in a sustainable, even predictable, way.

The idea may be great but expecting a sudden, violent uptake is delusional. Importantly, any idea is worthless without execution, and I think a lot of would-be entrepreneurs forget: *execution includes having customers* â€“ and in a saturated market with a high noise level, there's an important problem to solve early: finding customers.

If the next thing I move on to after Twitter is my own product, I will do my best to do the following: before designing, prototyping or building, *find potential customers* with the problem you're trying to solve. Understand them and the problem *as they see it* inside out. As swiftly as you can, produce something that *provides value*. Then, and only then, reach for technology. Don't default to it.
