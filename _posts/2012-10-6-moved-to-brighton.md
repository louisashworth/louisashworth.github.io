> Times, they are a-changin'.

I've moved to Brighton, postponing the second year of a Computer Science degree at Cardiff University. I'll be working for [Remy Sharp](//remysharp.com) at [LeftLogic](//leftlogic.com) building all kinds of real-time-y, mobile-y, Javascript-y stuff. My dream job.

Look out for big stuff to come.
