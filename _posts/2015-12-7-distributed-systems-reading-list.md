The workings of large distributed systems fascinate me. At the same time, working at Twitter has taught me hard lessons about the variety of exciting failure scenarios of a scaled system. "holy shit, everything's on fire" moments are my personal favourites.

So, I've been reading up.

Here's some stuff I've read and some I haven't. Enjoy.

- [What We Talk About When We Talk About Distributed Systems](http://videlalvaro.github.io/2015/12/learning-about-distributed-systems.html) — Fantastic article (and talk) with grounding in all the terminology.
- [Aphyr on Distributed Systems](https://aphyr.com/tags/Distributed-Systems) — Great blog. Kyle works on [Jepsen](https://github.com/aphyr/jepsen), and I learn something from every one of his posts.
- [Dist-sys Class Notes](https://github.com/aphyr/distsys-class) – More Aphyr, this time with notes from his distributed systems class. Great stuff, learned a tonne.
- [Notes on Distributed Systems for Young Bloods](http://www.somethingsimilar.com/2013/01/14/notes-on-distributed-systems-for-young-bloods/) — Jeff Hodges on how to think about distributed systems.
- [Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/time-clocks.pdf) — One of *the* dist-sys papers. Have dipped in and out, need to read it properly.
- [Readings in Database Systems](http://www.redbook.io) — aka. the "Red Book". Need to read, though it's more about data that dist-sys.
- [Clients are Jerks](http://caitiem.com/2015/06/23/clients-are-jerks-aka-how-halo-4-dosed-the-services-at-launch-how-we-survived/) — Catie McCaffrey on misbehaving clients. Good stuff.
- [Engineering for the Long Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0jGmgIrf_M&list=PL055Epbe6d5Y86GSg3nhUH3o_v62FGpCI&feature=youtu.be&app=desktop) — Really great talk from Velocity in Santa Clara 2015.
- [The Language of the System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROor6_NGIWU) — One of my all time favourite talks, by Rich Hickey. Not so much about dist-sys, but mind-expanding on the differences between systems and programs.
- [There is No Now](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2745385) — Problems with simultaneity in distributed systems. Eye-opening.

There's way more that I've forgotten about, so I'll come back and update this when I remember.

There's a good amount of writing on this topic, and it's becoming more and more accessible (less academic, more practical), but I haven't seen much written from the client-side perspective so I might try to contribute in some small way in that space. Poke me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/phuunet) if you want that article.
