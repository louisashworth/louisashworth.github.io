I am nineteen.

My life expectancy is around seventy-five years.

The history of the Web stretches back a mere two or three further years.

The first high-level programming language, FORTRAN, was invented in 1954 and von Neumann's stored-program model was conceived in 1945.

Let's say that the full history of computer programming as know it today extends back sixty years. That's a nice, round number.

I will, if things go my way, live as long as code has been around. That's sobering. How incredibly far computers have come in that time, coupled with the accelerating pace of change, makes me dizzy with the thought of where we could be in another sixty years. Awe-inspiring.

Of course, that time-span is a drop in the great ocean of human history as tool builders. When Steve Jobs said the computer is a bicycle for the mind, I think he underestimated.

But, there's another side to this. My knowledge does not encompass the first iota of what there is to know. While my mentality now is to move fast and do it all while I can, I can't help but wonder if we are all chasing smoke. Put Twitter and Facebook in the context what is yet to come and it all seems suddenly vacuous.

Nobody knows where we'll be next year, let alone in ten years or sixty years.

Then again, who cares? Honestly, I'm just happy to be along for the ride.
