title: "Elm: building Native modules"
---

I couldn't find any documentation on how to write modules written in pure JavaScript for [Elm][elm] so I took a stab at it myself, using [elm-d3][elm-d3] and the [Elm compiler][elm-compiler] as a reference. Here's a quick write-up.

It's important to note that doing this is *not encouraged* by Evan (the Elm creator). It's a hack and subject to compiler implementation changes. Use at your own risk.

## The problem

Elm is great but there are a number of useful functions that aren't implemented as standard or and aren't worth the effort to write in Elm itself. Elm has a JavaScript interoperability pattern called [ports][ports] but they're async and have a couple of other unfortunate constraints, so aren't ideal for some use-cases.

Sometimes you just gotta call a function.

## The solution

A quick bit of background to begin...

Elm imports look like this:

```haskell
import SomeModule
import AnotherModule ( specific, functions )
import AThirdModule ( .. ) -- all the things
import Native.Logger
```

At compile time the compiler goes out to find the modules you import (`SomeModule` maps to a file of the same name with a `.elm` extension) *unless* the module name has the prefix `Native.`.

If the name contains `Native.`, the Elm compiler will happily go on if the file doesn't exist. If the `.elm` files aren't there, it will blow up â€” this is good.

Assuming the files are present it compiles the importing code (roughly) like:

```haskell
var $Some$Module = Elm.SomeModule.make(_elm),
    $Another$Module = Elm.AnotherModule.make(_elm),
    $A$Third$Module = Elm.AThirdModule.make(_elm),
    $Native$Logger = Elm.Native.Logger.make(_elm);
```

You can see that it assumes the module will be there at runtime, and that it calls a `make` method to initialise the module. So we just need to add something to the `Elm.Native` namespace before the main apps loads (but after the runtime).

So, here's an example native module called `Logger`:

```haskell
Elm.Native.Logger = {};
Elm.Native.Logger.make = function(elm) {
    elm.Native = elm.Native || {};
    elm.Native.Logger = elm.Native.Logger || {};
    if (elm.Native.Logger.values) return elm.Native.Logger.values;
    return elm.Native.Logger.values = {
        log: function (x) {
            console.log(x);
            return x;
        }
    };
};
```

This pattern is copied more-or-less from compiled Elm code.

You can include this in the page in any way you like, so long as it comes after the Elm runtime:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Your App</title>

<!-- Runtime -->
<script src="elm-runtime.js"></script>
<!-- Native files -->
<script src="Native/Logger.js"></script>
<!-- Compiled Elm bundle -->
<script src="build/App.js"></script>
<script>
window.onload = function () {
    Elm.fullscreen(Elm.App);
};
</script>
```

In production, these files should be concatenated and minified.

Finally, here's a little snippet for generating these modules more easily:

```js
function ElmNativeModule(name, values) {
    Elm.Native[name] = {};
    Elm.Native[name].make = function(elm) {
        elm.Native = elm.Native || {};
        elm.Native[name] = elm.Native[name] || {};
        if (elm.Native[name].values) return elm.Native[name].values;
        return elm.Native[name].values = values;
    };
}
```

Use it like this:

```js
ElmNativeModule('Logger', {
    log: function (x) {
        console.log(x);
        return x;
    }
});
```

Remember, this is *not recommended*. Try to use ports first, and be prepared for this to break when the compiler implementation changes.
