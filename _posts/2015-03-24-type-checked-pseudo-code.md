> This man knows Haskell.

I'm finding Haskell increasingly useful day-to-day as a powerful tool for grappling with tough problems, particularly when building TweetDeck.

I've started to try to solve problems in Haskell first; its properties act as a forcing function to improve my work. It necessities — for example — *typing* the problem well, giving shape to the data and *thinking* about how it changes.

Type checking finds holes in thinking because it's just not possible to take shortcuts and often, if the code type-checks, it works. Haskell encourages abstraction and generalisation, which makes me think, simplify and think some more.

I've found that, switching back to my language of choice, I'm forced write code that's less abstract — more concrete — but that's OK: the implementation in Haskell will have influenced things to an extent that it's general-*enough* and abstract-*enough* to be flexible and maintainable in the future. Where the abstractions from Haskell are evident, the solution is often composable and reusable.

Best of all, Haskell doesn't feel like code. It feels like a language for thinking in: it's expressive, terse and simple, even as type-checked pseudo-code.
