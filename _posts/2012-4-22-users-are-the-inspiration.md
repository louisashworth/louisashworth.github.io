title: Users are the Inspiration
---
It means a huge amount to me that I'm working on a product people use every day, and I feel a great deal of responsibility to each and every one of our users.

There are two reasons you should put in the time to answer support emails: because you want to fix bugs in your product, and because it's one of the few times you actually get to **talk** with your customers (don't forget, they are customers too).

That interface time is invaluable.

There are two reasons you should put hours into fixing that really rare bug: because you're a hardcore perfectionist, and because you care about making your product an incredible experience for **all** of your users.

Build it great; they will come and they will share.

There are two reasons you should treat all your users with the same time and attention: those that are paying you are the reason you can feed yourself, and those who aren't paying you yet, aren't paying you **yet**.

Happy users turn into paying users.

For me, users are the inspiration.
