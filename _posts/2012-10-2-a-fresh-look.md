Hope you like it! I know it'll develop and change over time.

I found with the last design that I was constrained by the grid, so this one does away with it. Here's are my original goals for this remake; you can decide how many I achieved. There are other, technical, goals that I'll go for as I iterate.

### Focus

Just posts. No work, no play (no about?)

### UX

- Blog should be easier to read & paginated
- Permalinks more obvious & clickable
- Better prev/next links (with title?)
- Long & short form visually distinct?

### Enjoy!

I'm pleased with the reading experience, although mobile perhaps needs some work. Code now has much more space, which means I'll be much more liberal with code examples â€“ I was feeling constrained by that too.

Overall, I hope you like it, and do let me know what you think on [app.net](//alpha.app.net/phuu) or [Twitter](//twitter.com/phuunet).
