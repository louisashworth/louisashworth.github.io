title: A year to remember
---

For me, 2012 was an incredible year. This here's a sprint straight through it all, as much to remind me as anything else!

### University

In September I started a Computer Science degree at Cardiff University, and gave a short lecture to my year group on HTML5. I walked out of a lecture and nearly quit in January. The whole experience was very frustrating for me, which may well be a function of being single-minded to a fault.

### frittr

I built **frittr**, a wee money management tool, using Node and Mongo and Heroku – the latter two were more or less new to me. It taught me a lot about building products and where the real work lies – the stuff they don't tell you about. frittr wasn't a success at all, but was fun all the same, and restored the bug for building stuff.

### Show & Tell

I spoke at **Multipack Show & Tell** in February about Node, Mongo and Heroku based on experience from frittr. Buzzword heaven, yes, but it was my first taste of technical speaking to a knowledgable crowd, and a great experience.

### Multipack

After much discussion with various Multipackers, I redesigned and built the new **Multipack** website with much-appreciated coaching from [Andy Higgs](//higgsdesign.com). All in all, it took way, way too long to be launched (only launched in October-ish)!

### Buffer

As the uni year headed into exams I joined [Buffer](//bufferapp.com) "part-time", but worked almost full-time for them from April till August, including three weeks in baking-hot Tel Aviv. An amazing experience that taught me a lot about the world of startups, managing my own time and building a product. They moved to the States so it wasn't going to work out, but I'm very happy (and grateful) for the opportunity to work with that very talented – not to mention hard working – [bunch](//joel.is) [of](//leostartsup.com/) [guys](//tommoor.com/) and [girl](//alyssaaldersley.com).

### App.net

After coming back from Tel Aviv I was as something of a loose end. Fortunately, App.net arrived on the scene, and I picked it up and ran with it, building [the friend finder](//app.phuu.net) and [the cross poster](//twapp.phuu.net). Credit to Rich Cunningham and Ant Willaims (Multipackers both) for pushing me to do it, and to charge in particular. Both were a much greater success than I expected: approaching eight thousand people have found their friends, and around have 350 paid for Twapp to cross-post to Twitter.

I made quite a [screw-up](/2012/09/13/i-messed-up-i-am-sorry.html) however, posting to a number of my customer's Twitter accounts without them knowing. While some people were angry, after I'd apologised personally and profusely most were absolutely fine with it.

### Brighton

Around the same time I headed down to Brighton for my first conferences, [Reasons to be Creative](//www.reasonstobecreative.com/) and [dConstruct](//2012.dconstruct.org/), and for one of the most incredible weeks of my life.

I was fortunate enought to meet many people who I hold in very high regard, including the bemohawked Remy Sharp. I was preparing to head back to university, but he offered me a job. I accepted, and now here I am!

I have a lot to say about that experience and how I feel about it, but perhaps this isn't the time. Suffice it to say, I'm in my dream job and having a truly great time.

### The future

I'm looking forward to an incredible 2013. I have the option to go back to uni in September but it's not looking likely, because right now I'm having a blast working with the lovely family that is [Left Logic](//leftlogic.com) doing what I enjoy most: building shit.
