title: What cultural web issue would you like solved, tomorrow?
---
The web is experiencing growing pains, with legistators across the world try to catch up with the unparralled speed of communucation and change. Some feel strongly that internet and the web that sits atop it should be regulated not by government, but by its community. Others would have it tightly locked down with many of the same (or tighter) restrictions than in the 'real' world.

I asked Twitter for thoughts; I'll quote them here, and respond. If you have anything to add to the discussion, just email me.

We begin with file-sharing.

> Legalise file sharing! The \[opposition are\] making a it bigger problem than it is. I think legalising it would make the content-creating industry find better ways of getting their content to us... file sharing is the symptom of a system which is already broken.

I find this issue of file-sharing fascinating. An over-simplified viewpoint might say, “I'm entitled to lend a CD to a friend who could rip it to her computer – so why can't I share those files over the internet?”

But it doesn't take much to realise that a key difference here is scale – I can't realistically share a CD with the world, but I certainly can share a torrent file.

Dave here picks up on the issue being symtomatic of a greater problem, and I think that's definitely true. Regardless of the moral implications, the traditional media publishing is **broken**, but the solution isn't clear cut. That said, there are many who've embraced the changed and are benefiting greatly from it. Seth Godin is a perfect example.

The change in content distribution model has shifted power away from the publishers into the hands of the author and the consumer. Needless to say, I'm all for that.

Andy Higgs, a fellow <a href="//multipack.co.uk" title="Multipack">Multipacker</a>, brought up something that could help solve this problem. Here's his tweet, vertabim.

> Ubiquitous, cheap, standard, connected micro payment systems, because it is an economic floodgate for certain services.

I can't wait for this to be widely available. I already love services like <a href="//gumroad.com" title="Gumroad">Gumroad</a> that are designed to handling payment for anything you can share as a link, but it would be nice to cut out the middle man and have seamless payment from one person to another.

I should say, I'm totally naive to the tax implications of this, so it could be a pipe dream!

Rich Cunningham (<a href="//twitter.com/rythie" title="@rythie">@rythie</a>) pointed out that it “seems like we've had a decade of people trying”. Perhaps this is a very difficult problem, although I suspect it has to do with the deals any disruptive startup in this space would have to make with the banks; monolithic institutions that are (rightly?) resistant to change.

There's evidence things are changing though, with companies like <a href="//stripe.com" title="Stripe">Stripe</a> making waves; waves that are, to a great extent, limited to the US right now.

Do you have an opinion? <a href="mailto:tom@phuu.net">Email me</a> &ndash; I'd love to hear your thoughts – if you have something interesting to say, I'll publish it here.
