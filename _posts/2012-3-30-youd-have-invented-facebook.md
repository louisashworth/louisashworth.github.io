This quote, from The Social Network, hints at the difference between action and inaction. I find myself saying, "I had that idea months ago", nearly always followed by, "but I did nothing." It's irrelevant what the idea is, it means nothing if you don't act upon it.

This is why being able to code is so fantastically empowering. It's a privilege to be able to put something into the world just because you want it to exist. That said, you cannot merely will things into existence. After the 1% inspiration comes the 99% perspiration.

Even with the best idea in the world, if you do not, you get not.
