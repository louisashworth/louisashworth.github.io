title: Problems to Solve

I talked in my last post about education and about a new project I'm working on with [Walter](//twitter.com/waltercfilho).

Now I'd like to expand a little more on the specific problems we are looking to solve. Right now, nothing is under construction. I'm not happy beginning work until Walter & I have explored these problems thoroughly and know them well. This post is to express the first part of the manifesto.

### Prescriptive curricula

As you know, the content of lessons in school is, in the main, prescribed by the government in a curriculum that is tested in public examinations at 16 (year 11, GCSE), and then, if you go to sixth form, again for the next two years at AS and A2.

For the most part, students will not be taught any more than the content of the set curriculum. The textbooks are written, the course material is taught, the homework set and the exams taken. It's a single track path with very little wiggle room.

This isn't right, and we want to make it easier for students to access, explore and share this information in an environment that also allows teachers to monitor, and direct, the student's learning. If a student finds something that they find interesting and that they want to explore, they should be able to do so without being constrained by their curriculum.

They should be able to share that excitement about learning with anyone, not just those in their school environment.

### Virtual Learning Environments

A VLE is software that tries to emulate the classroom online, with virtual counterparts to tests, homework, classes and classrooms. They can also offer data access, resource hosting and a number of other features.

Most are hosted by the school or university and require administrative staff to keep the software running and apply updates.

Most cost a huge amount to buy and maintain, even if the maintenance is left to staff at the school.

Most suck.

I've had experience with Moodle (at school), the open-source PHP VLE, and Learning Central (or Blackboard – depends who you ask), Cardiff University's own system that, I believe, is developed by IBM to the cost of millions.

Teachers find them hard to use and students don't care. They go to them when they must, and no more.

Reinventing the VLE would be wrong and stupid; the backward compatibility nightmares would suck the life out of any small, dynamic product. But doing something different and smart that takes full advantage of what's possible with the web isn't, and that's one of our goals.

### A story

At my school we did the ICT GCSE short course two years early, at 14. It involves some spreadsheet, database and limited website work in HTML and CSS using WYSIWYG editors, and then an exam. No sweat.

At that point I was doing PHP and MySQL, and had been building websites for a while. I was bored of our curriculum and I wanted to find out new things and push myself. I'd found an AS & A2 Computing test program on the school network and I'd stared putting myself through the tests; I could get 50–70% on most AS stuff, and 40% or less on A2.

Wanting to get 100%, I tried to start learning about the things I didn't understand in the tests, so I went on Moodle to look at the course material there.

It had a password. I couldn't access the course material because of a password that was given only to A Level students. It stopped me in my tracks and was very frustrating because I couldn't explore an avenue that was of great interest to me.

I don't understand what is gained, by anyone, in limiting access to learning resources. There's no reason anyone should be stopped from learning about something they are interested in, and it's criminal to do so. This has to change.

### Go to the source

This first step to fixing a problem is identifying the source. While the above are problems in themselves, they are also symptoms of a larger, underlying problem with schooling.

But I hope that, by making a difference in these areas, we can stop restricting learning to what's on the curriculum and build a better learning environment for students and teachers.
