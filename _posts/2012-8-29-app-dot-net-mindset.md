My two App.net projects, a [friend-finder](//app.phuu.net) and a [cross-poster](//twapp.phuu.net), have both enjoyed some unexpected success. In fact, I've been totally blown away by the response and I'm very grateful to anyone who's bought twapp or tipped me!

A number of people have asked me whether the App.net community have been more receptive to paid apps than the Twitter community are, and why that might be so. It seems to me that it's down to the mindset of someone using App.net.

I think that an expectation that payment is involved in using the service is created because users have already paid $50+ for their account. Paying for another supplementary service is not a big hurdle because a larger payment has already taken place. In the case of Twitter, the central service is free which makes a paid ecosystem more difficult to establish.

In addition to this, most App.net users are die-hard early adopters, very willing to try out something new. This interest I've found also increases the chances the person is happy to pay to be first. Kickstarter's business model is partially based around that fact, and so is how App.net got funded.

When you consider this drive to be first, and the expectation of payment, it seems that App.net is a very good platform for developers to build user-focused products that don't rely on advertising becuase the users, by their nature, are willing to pay. It's a great thing.
