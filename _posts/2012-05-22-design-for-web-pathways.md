title: "Design for the Web: Pathways"
---

This is the second article in a series looking at the fundamentals of designing for the web. This time, I'm looking at links between information to figure out what makes great pathway design.

In the first article I looked at what's different about the web, and designing for it, compared to more traditional media like print or industrial design. The two key elements are structured information, not unique to the web, and the links between information.

### What makes great pathway design?

The first thing that comes to mind when we talk about designing pathways between information is site navigation. I've deliberatly tried to avoid references to ‘navigation’ becuase, while it is a good term, it has the connotations of large menus and dropdowns, both of which are examples of poor pathway design.

I use the word pathway becuase I mean the steps taken by a user in getting from seeking a piece of information to finding it, or in discovering related content.

Great pathway design must make the process of seeking and discovery as simple and intuitive as possible.

In a site with little content this is simple – you have five pages? Clearly display links to those five pages and make them easy to click. But what about an enormous site with many layers of content? Displaying everything is absolutely the worst thing to do.

Here's an example of when it goes wrong, from [Direct.gov.uk](http://direct.gov.uk).

![Direct.gov.uk - Oh dear.](http://i.phuu.net/0h0X23361W3Q020U3q0S/Screen%20Shot%202012-05-22%20at%2016.51.20.png)

The high density of information, with many elements vying for attention, makes this site horribly unusable. The site's header is also vibrant orange, which doesn't help.

There's no clear information heirachy and, as the next screenshot will show, your eye is drawn away from most important content on the page by pullout boxes.

![Direct.gov.uk - Where is you eye supposed to go?](http://i.phuu.net/3E3P0L3W170i041g3q2y/Screen-Shot-2012-05-22-at-16.51.20---blur.jpg)

Are you drawn to the main content – the list of key areas of the site – or to the colourful social media icons in the lower left?

Certainly the icons are not where you should be looking.

This is poor pathway design.

One option on a content heavy site is search, and [gov.uk](http://gov.uk) has done it very well.

![gov.uk gets it right](http://i.phuu.net/441n400s2Y3d1A3U3I3h/Screen%20Shot%202012-05-22%20at%2017.03.02.png)

Front and center is an intelligent search bar that makes suggestions as you type. Beneath is roughly the same information found on Direct.gov.uk, but this time it's given room to breath, and the eye is not distracted by all manner of irrelevant page-stuffing.

It works becuase, even if you know what you are looking for, it's much faster to type than to read a list looking for the correct option.

A search bar also allows the user to express the information they are looking for in their own terms – it doesn't require them to have the same mental model of the information as the person who ‘designed’ the page, as seach will pick out keywords from the actual content, not someone's summary of it.

There are other clues on this page that thought has gone into pathway design; the Browse section is sorted alphabetically and is kept short, and Popular topics are highlighted to the right.

Gov.uk serves the exact same content as Direct.gov.uk, but which site would you rather use?

Gov.uk is a joy to use because of great pathway design and thoughtful planning.

Next time I'll go further into gov.uk and explore what they're doing to build pathways between related information, and to assist users in getting what they need.

Thanks for reading.
