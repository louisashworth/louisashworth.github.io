title: "Physical and Mental Exertion"

If you’re the kind of person that does hard exercise, do you find yourself comparing one particular struggle to another?

I do, and the same with coding;

> “This code is hard, but that problem last week was way more complicated so you must be able to do this…”

I’ve also found myself comparing physical exertion to the mental equivalent in code:

> “These tests are fucked, but that hill was massive and your legs really hurt, so just fucking get through it.”

I sort of thought everyone did this, but it turns out perhaps they don’t. If you’ve never thought about it that way, perhaps it’s useful to you?

Let me know.
