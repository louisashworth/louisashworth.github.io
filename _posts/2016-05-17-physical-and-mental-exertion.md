title: "Physical and Mental Exertion"
---

If you’re the kind of person that does hard exercise, do you find yourself comparing one particular struggle to another?

I do, and the same with coding:

> “This code is hard, but that problem last week was way more complicated so I **must** be able to do this…”

I’ve also found myself comparing physical exertion to the mental equivalent in code:

> “These tests are fucked, but that hill was massive and my legs were really hurting, so **just fucking get through this**.”

I sort of thought everyone did this, but it turns out perhaps they don’t. If you’ve never thought about it that way maybe it’s useful to you?

Let me know.
