Ofsted, the school inspection body, published [a report](//www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/110134.pdf) in December 2011 that investigated the use of ICT in 167 schools across the UK between 2008 and 2011, including the use of virtual learning environments. Here's a whirlwind tour of the report, and some conclusions.

### The findings

A number of weaknesses were identified including, "limited teacher capability in key topics such as programming," and, "lack of attention to the needs and interests of more able students", identifying a particular failure at the Key Stage 4 level – 14 to 16 years old – where students were not aware of, or able to explore, options for higher learning in ICT and Computing.

This is further evidence of the wider problem of a teaching cohort unskilled in computing any more advanced than word processing and spreadsheets. It's been identified before and will, I believe, be fixed naturally over time.

Interestingly, though unsurprisingly perhaps, the report described, "a move away from dedicated computer suites and a growing emphasis on laptops and handheld devices,", which follows a global trend towards mobile computing.

To me, any product or service entering this space should have a similar focus on a strong mobile aspect, which goes with conventional web development wisdom. Walter and I have already identified this as a key area; engaging students where they spend much of their time – on their phones – could prove very important to helping them learn outside of the classroom.

### Virtual Learning Environment

Upon investigating the use of virtual learning environments in schools, Ofsted found that, while VLEs had been effective in a number of cases, there were a range of issues associated with, "a lack of support from the local authority, delays caused by technical difficulties or lack of available training". While I don't think I need to say anything about the inefficiencies of a local authority, I do think it's worth addressing technical difficulties and lack of available training.

There are two types of technical difficulty that this could be addressing; relating to the development of the VLE and to difficulty of operation and maintenance by teaching staff. Walter and I hope to address both by adopting a more agile development methodology.

By building a product upon which we'd iterate, not a one-time bespoke solution, I think we can achieve a lower cost for the school, and a service that more closely serves the needs of the users: the pupils and teachers.

By working *with* pupils and teachers I think we can avoid a situation where a teacher feels lost or unable to carry out a task. Of course, there's no reason we cannot provide training and great customer support. The latter is imperitive, in fact.

A lack of meaningful customer support is an inherent problem with any bespoke solution, as the development team have moved on and are working on something else – we can solve this, and mentioned above, by iterating on a single product.

The report also concluded that, "there was often a reliance on a single enthusiast, a teacher or governor, to resolve obstacles and delays," which is concordant with my experience of virtual learning environments. Again, by centralising the service so that schools do not have to install, host and maintain it, we can avoid this kind of reliance and deliver regular updates to everyone simultaneously.

### Building the picture

In these posts I'm trying to build a picture of the problems that need to be solved, so that we can formulate an effective solution in one small area and work outwards. It's been great to see others engaging with our idea – hopefully we can resonate in the right places and enact real change.
